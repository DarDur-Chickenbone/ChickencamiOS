# ChickencamiOS

## What is this app?
By default when uploading a gallery photo to Snapchat either to a friend or story, it will either send via chat or add a annoying watermark to your story. Chickencam eliminates this, by using Snapchat's developer kit you could completely bypass this.
### Use this to:
* Upload stock camera photos/videos without shitty snapchat quality
* High Quality Advertisments
* Custom GIF/Stickers

## Why this App?
People in the past have created similar apps and charged people hundreds of dollars just to use it. ChickenCam is completely free and open source so it will stop sketchy scammers

## Will I get banned for using this?
It is known that passed Snapchat tweaks would result in a ban, for example Casper, Snaptools, etc. However because this is directly from Snapchat's developer kit there is absolutely no chance of being banned. **Keep in mind there is a risk of someone reporting you for uploading something "nasty" -- be careful of who's on your friend's list.**

## If you don't want your stories to show "from Camera"
1. Upload image/video using the app.
2. Edit the photo however you want
3. Save the photo to memories
4. Immediately upload the photo to your story.
